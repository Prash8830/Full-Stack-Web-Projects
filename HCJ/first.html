    <p>i think tiger is aggressive but not strong than lion</p>

    <p>You might <strong> remember from high school</strong> health class that muscle weighs more than fat, which helps
        explain the tiger’s extra pounds. So it seems that the tiger would have a physical advantage over the lion.

        <br> But it turns out that we have some historical data to add to this conjecture, too. In ancient Rome, the
        tiger-lion face-off wasn’t uncommon. In 1959, a reader asked the Spokesman-Review this question, and the paper,
        in turn, asked William Bridges, the curator of publications at the Bronx Zoo. He told them that “back in the day
        of the Roman Coliseum, the smart money usually backed the tiger.” While we don’t have any great descriptions of
        the outcomes, ancient paintings of the event usually showed the tiger winning. And in the late 1800′s, the
        Gaekwad of Baroda, an Indian ruler, arranged a fight between the two beasts. Before the fight began, those
        running the bettor set the odds at 1 to 37,000 that the tiger would win. It did, and the Gaekwad lost 37,000
        rupees.

        <br> And in 2011, a tiger <em>killed a lion with a single</em> paw swipe in a run in at Ankara Zoo in Turkey.
        The tiger apparently found a gap in the fence, and made its way into the lion’s enclosure. When they met, the
        tiger severed the lion’s jugular vein in just one stroke. Craig Saffoe, a biologist at the Smithsonian Zoo, also
        generally favored the tiger, telling LiveScience, “What I’ve seen from tigers, they seem to be more aggressive;
        they go for the throat, go for the kill. Whereas the lions are more, ‘I will just pound you and play with you.’”

        <br> But fighting in an arena, and even in a zoo, is quite different than fighting in the wild. If a tiger were
        to meet a lion without cages or screaming fans, what would happen? That’s actually a question that some
        conservationists are having to answer right now. There’s a plan to move some Asiatic lions to from the Gir
        forest to Kuno Palpur, where there are tigers. The University of Minessota’s Lion Research Center says that the
        plan has been delayed for fear that the native tigers would kill the lions. But in the wild, they say, tigers
        and lions fight quite differently:
